## Learning Outcomes

While building this project, I practiced:

- Structuring a full landing page using semantic layout elements
- Designing responsive interfaces for different screen sizes
- Using Flexbox and Grid for alignment and spacing
- Managing typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy

## Limitations

This project is a static frontend clone. Interactive elements such as FAQ toggling and authentication flows are not implemented.

## Future Improvements

- Add JavaScript to implement FAQ accordion behavior
- Improve semantic HTML and accessibility (alt text, labels, landmarks)
- Refactor CSS using variables and improved naming conventions
- Enhance UI polish and animations
